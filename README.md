# ai-opportunities

An industry scan of the AI ecosystem — a structured overview of where the field stands, what's being built, and where the gaps are. Built to help builders orient themselves across five layers, from consumer-facing applications down to model consumption APIs.

**Live:** [nc1z.github.io/ai-opportunities](https://nc1z.github.io/ai-opportunities)

## What this is

The taxonomy covers five layers of the AI stack where most builders actually operate:

1. **Application Layer** — products and use cases shipped to end users
2. **Agent & Workflow Layer** — orchestration patterns, agent topologies, human oversight
3. **Harness & Runtime Layer** — context, memory, tool orchestration, safety, observability
4. **Developer Tooling Layer** — evals, prompt management, SDKs, CI/CD, guardrails
5. **Model Consumption Layer** — how applications access, route, and optimise model calls

Deep infrastructure — compute, semiconductors, and foundation model training — is intentionally excluded.

## Research methodology

The taxonomy was built through a structured multi-agent deep research process. Five AI research agents were independently tasked with analysing the AI landscape across each layer. Signals were cross-validated by source agreement count and merged into a unified taxonomy before any code was written.

Agents were selected with reference to the [DeepResearch-Bench leaderboard](https://deepresearch-bench.github.io) — an independent benchmark for deep, multi-step research tasks.

See the [About page](https://nc1z.github.io/ai-opportunities/#/about) for full methodology.
